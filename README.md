# Color Reference
Something born out of frustration. I had a bunch of e-books and no internet. On the plus side, e-books had a list of color names and code. On the other hand, there's no way to see how the actual colors look like. So, I made my own color reference.

Current features:
- a list of colors along with names, hex code and hsl numbers
- colors zoom on hover
- responsive design
- sortable cards using [HTML5Sortable](https://github.com/lukasoppermann/html5sortable)

To do:
- better way to populate list of colors instead of hardcoding them
